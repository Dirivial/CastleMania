# CastleMania

A game to show off WFC (Wave Function Collapse)

### A couple things left before I deem this project to be done:

- [x] Use random seed each time (currently I use `0` each time)

- [x] Look around to see if I can find a reason for the bugged tile.
      If I can't find it, I will honestly just ignore it.

- [x] Store highscore in some file and display that when player dies

  - [x] Update highscore list when player dies

- [x] Main menu

- [x] Build binary

- [ ] Upload to itch.io
