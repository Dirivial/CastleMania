# CastleMania

A game to show off WFC (Wave Function Collapse)

### A couple things left before I deem this project to be done:

- [ ] Use random seed each time (currently I use `0` each time)

- [ ] Look around to see if I can find a reason for the bugged tile.
      If I can't find it, I will honestly just ignore it.

- [ ] Store highscore in some file and display that when player dies

  - [ ] Update highscore list when player dies

- [ ] Main menu

- [ ] Build binary

- [ ] Upload to itch.io
